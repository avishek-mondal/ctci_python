# Description

These are my solutions to the CTCI book. Heavily inspired by the original CTICI repositories [here](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python) and [here](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition). I am not contributing to them because I also experiment with other features of python in this repository

# Special files
## tlog.py

tlog, or temporary log, is just a structlog global logger. I use it instead of print statements.
